<h1>Welcome to <i>Shark<sup>3</sup></i></h1>
Shark<sup>3</sup> is a mac application that runs a local flask web application. It provides basic information about the 8 coil Helmholtz array located in the New College of Florida Pritzker Marine Lab. Additionally, it has a current caclulator, which calculateds the required current needed in the coils of the array in order to create a local magnetic field of a desiged strength. The purpose of <i>Shark<sup>3</sup></i> was to easily allow Marine Biology students at New College of Florida to caclulated the current they'd need to create magnetic field for behavioral experiments, as well as provide information about the design of <i>Shark<sup>3</sup></i>.
